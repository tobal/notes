    - Each turn assess the board state and decide what you want to achieve this turn. This could be picking up
    the ball and making a cage around the ball carrier. It could be getting your squishy players away from the
    opponent and setting up a new defensive line. Whatever the case, this general goal will guide you to decide
    what is vital and what is not. At its most simple go -: no risk then vital then non vital.
