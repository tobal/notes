* How I began to learn to play Age of Empires 4
** Intro
   Hi there everyone, it's Tobal here. I always try to find new things to learn, whatever it is that fascinates me at the
   moment. In this, and two subsequent videos, I will show you how RTS games caught my interest in the recent past, and how
   I am learning how to play a specific one, Age of Empires 4. If you are also a fellow beginner, I hope this video can
   inspire you in some way. You can find the links in the description to everything which is referenced during the course
   of the video.
** How I began to learn to play RTS games
   I liked RTS games ever since I had access to a PC as a kid, I even considered it my favorite genre at one point. My
   previous experiences with the genre will be the topic of a separate video, but long story short, I always liked the
   Blizzard RTS style the most - which can be attributed to the fact that WarCraft 2 was the first RTS game I ever played.
   But I distanced from the genre after StarCraft, I was playing mostly Total War games, when I wanted to play a strategy
   game. When StarCraft 2 came out, I played it because I was interested in the story (the Hybrid storyline specifically,
   which they forshadowed in the Brood War campaign)... but the story of StarCraft 2 was disappointing for me after the
   first two campaigns, so when Legacy of the Void came out, I didn't even play it.
*** Lowko's castings
    It was around 2020 when I started watching StarCraft 2 matches, primarily on Lowko's channel. Maybe it had something to
    do with the lockdown, I don't know... but suddenly, I felt the urge to play StarCraft 2 again, but not the campaign, but
    skirmish matches. Previously I exclusively played campaign, and I knew that I suck at it. But I thought back to the times
    when RTS was my favorite genre, and I figured it would be nice to... not suck at it.

    However, I didn't know how to start. Watching pro-level players play the game made me realize that I pretty much don't
    know anything about how to play an RTS game. From the casted matches, I didn't understand anything, even though I played
    the game earlier, and knew the units. I realized that StarCraft 2 had a plethora of strategies which is part of the meta,
    the byproduct of a long history of meta changes, and I would need to learn most of them to be successful at the game. I
    got discouraged, and gave up before I even started... until I found Altercate's channel.
*** StarCraft 2 videos by Altercate SC
    [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL13He6PQGnKIAQaADnbJAbMCvghxTWLQ9][Starcraft 2 for Beginners youtube list]]
    Altercate has a really good playing list, which teaches how to play StarCraft 2 skirmish from the ground up. It was just
    what I needed. The two most important takeaways from the videos for me was the importance of build orders, the macro-cycle,
    and that I have to produce workers constantly. These concepts were very new for me at that time.
*** Played against AI
    So now that I had a very clear picture on how to start practicing, I picked a race and started playing skirmishes against
    the AI. I picked terran, even though my favorite race in the StarCraft universe was always protoss... I picked terran
    because I knew it's the most straightforward race to play, and I wanted to learn to walk before learning to fly. A followed
    the build order, I did the macro-cycle, and it gave me some success against lower difficulty AI. But when I got to Hard
    difficulty, I was just mowed down. Even though I had far better economy, and more units, the Hard AI always just
    completely destroyed my army. I figured it is because my micro was basically just an A-move. I tried a few time to micro my
    units better, but to no avail. I thought maybe Starcraft is too fast paced for me, I got discouraged again, and stopped
    playing.
** Finding Age of Empires 4
*** Watch Age of Empires 4 matches, Drongo's castings
    Approximately a year later, I started watching Age of Empires 4 matches. To be frank, I wasn't very hyped about AoE4, when
    it was released. For a fair bit of time, I didn't even take a look at it. Back in the day, I played a few campaigns with
    AoE2, and I liked it, but didn't even try out AoE3. That game didn't catch my attention, and to be entirely honest, I think
    it's because the 3D graphics didn't capture the charm of previous Age of Empires games in my eyes. I know it's lame to
    dismiss a game just because of graphics, but it is what it is.
    
    But AoE4 had the same charming visuals as the first two games, and maybe that's why I started watching casted games. I mostly
    watched Aussie Drongo's castings - love that guy btw -, and I was hooked by them. Never before did something like this happen
    to me, but I started to follow tournaments, got to know the pro players and the casters, and most importantly, I learned
    a bunch of stuff about the civilizations, just by watching these. I watched the meta slowly evolving in front of my eyes,
    from patch to patch, watched dominant strategies come and go, and this taught me much about the game, and about RTS games
    in general. Also, I noticed that Lidakor, a prominent caster, and Szal√°mi, a quite famous player in the AoE scene - you may
    know him as the vololo-god -, are both from Hungary just as I do, and that was nice to see.
*** Why I chose Rus
    So, needless to say, I got interested in playing the game. And from the casted matches, I already knew which will be my
    favorite civilization: Rus. They hunt for food, they have strong palisades, they have horse archers, and most importantly:
    warrior monks. Ever since Shogun Total War 1, I love warrior monks, even though the two units are nothing alike, besides
    the name. They are on horseback, and can fight, even can buff the other units... it was so fucking cool. So I started to
    practice with Rus.

    There were a few advantages in picking the Rus as the first civ to learn, even though these advantages didn't influence me
    at all when I chose it. They are a fairly straightforward civ, so I don't need to fiddle with more complex mechanics as a
    beginner, and the early game is quite micro intensive, which is good for me, because my micro is very weak, and I need to
    practice it.
*** Watch build order guides from Grubby
    The first build order I learned with Rus, I learned from Grubby. It wasn't he, who came up with it, but it was the one
    everyone used at that time. It was the professional scouts build, where you bring all the hunt under the TC, so you don't
    need to leave your base, go castle, and then overwhelm the opponent with horse archers and scouts. I only practiced this
    build against AI, and I couldn't even beat the hardest AI, but this was the first proper build order I learned, and I had
    a lot of fun with it.
** Going multiplayer
*** Found Beasty's guides, learned and practiced
    But a few patches after that, the pro scouts build was no longer viable, so I had to look for another one. That was around
    the time when I found BeastyQT's guides, after he grabbed my attention by winning N4C. I discovered that he really wants
    to help other players get better at the game, and has a bunch of informative guides for beginners, so I started practicing
    his season 1 build order. I got fairly decent with it, and after I could defeat the hardest AI, I figured it would be timely
    to try myself in multiplayer.

*** Ranking matches
    The thing is, at this point, I still didn't know what I was doing. I was the one trick pony of one trick ponies. I didn't
    know how to scout, how to respond to what the opponents does, I just blindly followed the build, and hoped that I win. If
    you look at my first five matches, you will see what I mean. I go feudal, I build the archery ranges, push the enemy with
    archers, knights and rams, and that's it. If the push does not work, I don't know what to do. I even gave up a few times
    prematurely, because I didn't know how to progress with the game. Not to say that I didn't win, I had a few victories here
    and there. After the ranking matches, I god Silver 3, and not long after, I got Gold 1, which was better than I expected.
    Still a very low rank, but I thought it was a good start.

    Still, it bothered me very much that my playstyle is very rigid. It culminated in a match where I got busted by someone with
    a much lower rank, just because of my tunnel vision. After that, a kind of multiplayer dread took over me, and I didn't have
    the drive to play the game anymore.

    But this was just the beginning of the story. In part 2 of this video, I'll tell you about how I got help from a very
    unexpected source. And in part 3, I'll tell you about my season 3 adventures, so stay tuned if you're interested. Cheers.
