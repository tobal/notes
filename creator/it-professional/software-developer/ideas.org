** Authenticator phone
   A docker for the phone, which can authenticate me based on evidence that I hace my phone. It's a convenience feature, that
   I don't have to type my password. When I dock the phone, all the computers will start which I turned on in the Android app.
*** Security risks
*** Autostart feature
**** Can I start with different boot parameters?
